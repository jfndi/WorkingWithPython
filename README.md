# Woking with Python.

This is a set of scripts that I have used (and still using) to write actual real world
Python projects.

Most of them, if not all, are very simple. Some will say simplistic. But it is on purpose.
I can't stand anymore those scripts that are supposed to illustrate concepts but those 
same concepts are clobbered by fancy useless esoteric tricks.
