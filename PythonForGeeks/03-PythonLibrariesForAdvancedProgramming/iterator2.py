    This example implements the Week class, which stores the numbers and names
    of all weekdays in a dictionary. This class is not iterable by default. To
    make it iterable the __iter__ method is implemented. The __next__ method
    is also added.
    NOTE: The way described is not the recommended approach. The reason is that
    in the code below, the iterator is the object itself.
